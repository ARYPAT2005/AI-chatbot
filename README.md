# Pharma

I created a full-stack application called Pharma, an AI-powered study tool for pharmacy students that features a chatbot and flashcard generator using OpenAI GPT-4o. I built the frontend with React and Vite, developed a RESTful API with Express.js, implemented JWT-based authentication, and used MongoDB for data storage to ensure secure and scalable user interactions.

## Features
* AI-Powered Chatbot & Flashcard Generation – Integrated OpenAI GPT-4o to enable intelligent, conversational responses and automatic flashcard creation based on user input, enhancing personalized learning.
* JWT-Based Authentication – Implemented secure login functionality using JSON Web Tokens, with support for token refresh and expiry to protect user sessions.
* RESTful API Design – Built a robust backend with Express.js to manage user data and flashcards, enabling efficient CRUD operations and scalability.
* MongoDB Data Storage – Utilized MongoDB to store and organize user-generated content and progress, ensuring reliable access and data integrity.
* Modern Frontend – Developed a fast and responsive user interface using React and Vite, allowing for smooth user interactions and minimal load times.
